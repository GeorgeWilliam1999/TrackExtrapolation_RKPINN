# V2 Utilities

Shared utility modules for V2 experiments.

Same as V1 utilities - see [V1/utils](../../V1/utils/) for details.

## Modules

- `magnetic_field.py` - Field interpolation
- `rk4_propagator.py` - Track propagation
- `physics_loss.py` - Physics loss functions

## Note

V2 uses the same utilities as V1. The improvements are in the model architectures,
not the underlying physics calculations.
